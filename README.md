# Memory Card Game

This is a mini project built for one of the assignments on the Odin Project. The project is a memory card game based off the characters in League of Legends, and players must memorize each champion they click or they lose. This project was built to practice my knowledge of React, more specifically, functional components, lifecycles, and hooks such as useState and useEffect.
